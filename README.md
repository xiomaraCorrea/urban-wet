Visualizing data on Nasa World Wind

In this project the "Home" page is the "Nasa_WorldWind.html".

The second page will be "Scenarios.html" and, after clicking the first option of each column, a page with the "corresponding" color pattern for the selected scenario should appear.

After clicking the submit button, I have only made one page with only the first choice of each colum until we can found a solution about instead of making 60+ pages we can have one page that change its content according with the selected choices of the table. 

The JSON file that I'm using to show the data is in /src/reaches.json
